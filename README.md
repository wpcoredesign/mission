# Mission
Our mission is the longevity of WordPress.

This is a personally-funded project led by [John Maeda](https://github.com/johnmaeda) with [Mark Uraine](https://github.com/mapk), [Matías Ventura](https://github.com/mtias), [Ashleigh Axios](https://github.com/aaxios), [Joen Asmussen](https://github.com/jasmussen) to _imagine-out-loud_ how design can have a greater impact on WordPress Core.

We believe it has to do with inviting more designers to be included in WordPress’ future. So this is a tiny, safe place within which to gather resources we think might be useful for designers who wish to crossover to tech.
